## Features and Usage
The application supports both Light and Dark Mode. In Dark mode, the application changes its text and background colour to prevent straining your eyes.

Light Mode Preview:

Once the user defines his choice ( rock, paper, or scissors ) the other options get disabled. This means that the user cannot change his choice mid way during the game.

The user can also reset the score at any point to 0-0 and start a fresh match.
