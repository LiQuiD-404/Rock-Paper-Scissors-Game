## About The Project


We have all played Rock, Paper, Scissors with our friends and siblings in our childhood, may it be for choosing who will bat first in a cricket match or to check who will tidy up the room. Rock Paper Scissors was one game we all loved to play. Now with the help of JavaScript we can play the same Rock, Paper, Scissors with our computer.

## Features and Usage
The application supports both Light and Dark Mode. In Dark mode, the application changes its text and background colour to prevent straining your eyes.

Light Mode Preview:

Dark Mode Preview:

Once the user defines his choice ( rock, paper, or scissors ) the other options get disabled. This means that the user cannot change his choice mid way during the game.

The user can also reset the score at any point to 0-0 and start a fresh match.
